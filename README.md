# The Process of Learning

Hi! My name is Devin and I'm a software developer. What I enjoy most about the world of software is there is always something new to learn. The opportunity to get just a little more knowledgable than you were the day before.

In my opinion, reading documentation to implement a solution is different than *learning*. This repository is dedicated to my desire to learn by exploring my true understanding of a concept through my writings and code examples.

Thanks!
